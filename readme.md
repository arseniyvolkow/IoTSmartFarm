# üöÄ SmartFarm: An IoT Platform for Smart Agriculture

## üåü About The Project

**SmartFarm** is more than just a pet project; it's a complete backend system designed with a microservices architecture to power a smart farming operation. The platform enables real-time data collection from IoT sensors, remote device management (e.g., irrigation systems), and data analysis to boost crop yields.

---

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system is built on the asynchronous FastAPI framework and is fully containerized using Docker. Sensor data is ingested via the MQTT protocol and stored in a time-series database (InfluxDB), while user and device metadata is managed in a PostgreSQL database.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Technical Highlights

This project was a great opportunity to solve several interesting engineering challenges:

* **‚úÖ Secure Authentication & Authorization:** Developed a robust security layer using **JWT tokens**. Implemented role-based access control (RBAC) to protect endpoints, distinguishing between regular users and administrators.
* **‚úÖ Real-Time Data Ingestion:** Engineered an asynchronous pipeline with an **MQTT broker** to handle high-throughput data streams from potentially thousands of IoT sensors.
* **‚úÖ Time-Series Data Management:** Integrated **InfluxDB** to efficiently store, query, and analyze time-series data (e.g., "fetch temperature readings from Sensor X over the last 24 hours").
* **‚úÖ Resilient Microservices Architecture:** Designed a distributed system by decoupling logic into independent services (**User Service**, **Farm Management Service**, **Sensor Data Service**, **Rule Service**). Each service is containerized with **Docker** for isolation and scalability.
* **‚úÖ Automation workflows:** Implement a rule engine to allow users to create custom automation workflows (e.g., "if soil moisture drops below 30%, turn on sprinklers for 5 minutes").

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started & Local Setup

You can get a local instance up and running easily with Docker.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/arseniyvolkow/IoTSmartFarm.git
    cd smartfarm
    ```
2.  **Configure your environment:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory (you can copy `example.env` as a template) and fill in your credentials for PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, etc.
3.  **Launch the application:**
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    Once the containers are running, the API documentation for each service will be available at:
    * User Service Docs: `http://localhost/api/user-service/docs`
    * Farm Management Service Docs: `http://localhost/api/farm-management-service/docs`
    * Rule Service Docs: `http://localhost/api/rule-service/docs`
    * Sensor Data Retrival Service Docs: `http://localhost//api/sensor-data/docs`
